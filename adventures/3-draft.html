      <h2>Episode 3: Setting up your personal server</h2>
      
      <h3>Why you need a server</h3>
      <p>Last week we created an unhosted javascript/html/markdown editor that can run on a data URL, create other apps as data URLs,
        load files from the local file system, and (sort of clumsily) also save them again. This doesn't however allow us to
        communicate with other devices, nor with other users, let alone people in other "web 2.0 worlds". At some point we
        will want to send and receive emails and chat messages, so to do those thing with an unhosted web app, we need a sort
        of proxy server.</p>
      <p>There are three important restrictions of unhosted web apps compared to hosted web apps:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>they are not addressable from the outside. Even if your device has its own static IP address, the application instance
          (for instance the editor we created last week) is running in one of the tabs of one of your browsers, and does not have
          the possibility to open any ports that listen externally on the internet address of your device.</li>
        <li>the data they store is emprisoned in one specific device, which is not practical if you use multiple devices, or if your device
          is damaged, lost or stolen.</li>
        <li>they cannot run when you have your device switched off, and cannot receive data when your device is not online, or
          on a low-bandwidth connection</li>
      </ul>
      <p>For these reasons, you cannot run your online life from unhosted web apps alone. You will need a personal server on the web.
        To run your own personal server on the web, there are initially four components you need to procure:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>a virtual private server (VPS),</li>
        <li>a domain name registration (DNR),</li>
        <li>a zone record at a domain name service (DNS), and</li>
        <li>a secure server certificate (TLS).</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Shopping for the bits and bobs</h3>
      <p>The VPS is the most expensive one, and will cost you about 15 US dollars a month from for instance Rackspace. The domain name will cost you
        about 10 US dollars per year from for instance Gandi, and the TLS certificate you can get for
        free from StartCom, or for very little money from other suppliers as well. You could in theory set up your DNS hosting on your VPS, but
        usually your domain name registration will include free DNS hosting.</p>
      <p>Unless you already have a domain name, you need to make an important choice at this point, namely choosing the domain name that will become
        your personal identity on the web. Most people have the same username in different web 2.0 worlds, for instance I often use 'michielbdejong'.
        When I decided it was time for me to create my own Indie Web presence, and went looking for a domain name a few months ago, 'michielbdejong.com'
        was still free, so i picked that. Likewise, you can probably find some domain name that is in some way related to usernames you already use
        elsewhere.</p>
      <p>I registered my TLS certificate for 'apps.michielbdejong.com' because I aim to run an apps dashboard on there at some point, but you could
        also go for 'www.' or 'blog.' or whichever subdomain tickles your fancy.
        In any case, you get one subdomain plus the root domain for free, plus as many extra origins as you want on ports other than 443.
        So you cannot create endless subdomains, but you can host different kinds of content in subdirectories (like this blog that is hosted on
        /adventures on the root domain of unhosted.org), and you can get for instance
        <a href="https://michielbdejong.com:10001/">https://michielbdejong.com:10001/</a> as an isolated javascript
        origin that will work on the same IP address and SSL certificate.</p>
      <p><em><strong>No Cookie Crew - Warning #1:</strong>
        Last week's tutorial could be followed entirely with cookies disabled. I am probably still the only person in the world who has all cookies
        disabled, but in case readers of this blog want to join the "No Cookie Crew", I will start indicating clearly where violations are required.
        Although Rackspace works without cookies (with URL-based sessions over https), StartCom uses client-side certificates in their wizard and
        other services are also likely to require you to enable cookies. In any case, you need to acquire three actual products here, which means you
        will be logging in to second-party e-commerce applications, and also corresponding control-panel applications which are hosted by each vendor.
        So that in itself is not a violation, but you will also probably need to use some desktop or hosted application to confirm your email address
        while signing up, and you will need something like an ssh and scp client for the next steps.</em></p>

      <h3>First run</h3>
      <p>Once you have your server running, point your domain name to it, and upload your TLS certificate to it. The first thing you always want to do
        when you ssh into a new server is to update it. On Debian this is done by typing:</p><pre><code>
apt-get update
apt-get upgrade
</code></pre>
      <p>There are several ways to run a
        server, but here we will use <a href="http://nodejs.org">nodejs</a>, because it's fun and powerful. So follow the instructions on the nodejs
        website to
        install it onto your server. Nodejs comes with the 'node' executable that lets you execute javascript programs, as well as the 'npm' package
        manager, that gives you access to a whole universe of very useful high-quality libraries.</p>
        
      <h3>Your webserver</h3>
      <p>Once you have node working, you can use the example from the
        <a href="http://docs.nodejitsu.com/articles/HTTP/servers/how-to-serve-static-files">nodejitsu docs</a>
        to set up your website; adapted here to make it serve your website from https:</p><pre><code>
var static = require('node-static'),
    http = require('http'),
    https = require('https'),
    fs = require('fs'),
    config = {
      domain: 'michielbdejong.com',
      contentDir: '/var/www',
      tlsDir: '/root/tls'
    };

http.createServer(function(req, res) {
  req.on('end', function() {
    res.writeHead(302, {
      Location: 'https://'+config.domain+'/'+req.url.substring(1),
        'Access-Control-Allow-Origin': '*'
      });
    res.end('Location: https://'+config.domain+'/'+req.url.substring(1));
  });
}).listen(80);

var file = new(static.Server)(config.contentDir, {
  'Access-Control-Allow-Origin': '*'
});

https.createServer({
  key: fs.readFileSync(config.tlsDir+'/tls.key'),
  cert: fs.readFileSync(config.tlsDir+'/tls.cert'),
  ca: fs.readFileSync(config.tlsDir+'/ca.pem')
}, file.serve).listen(443);
</code></pre>
      <p>Here, tls.key and tls.cert are the secret and public parts of your TLS certificate, and
        the ca.pem is an extra <a href="http://www.startssl.com/certs/sub.class1.server.ca.pem">StartCom chain certificate</a>
        that you <a href="https://www.startssl.com/?app=20">will need</a> if you use a StartCom certificate.</p>
      <p>Note that we also set up an http website, that redirects to your https website, and we have added
        <a href="http://enable-cors.org/">CORS headers</a> everywhere, to do our bit in helping break down the web's "Same Origin" walls.</p>
      <h3>Using 'forever' to start and stop server processes</h3>
      <p>Now that you have a script for a http server and a https server, upload them to your server, and then run:</p><pre><code>
npm install  node-static
npm install -g forever
forever start path/to/myWebServer.js
forever list
</pre></code>
      <p>If all went well, you will now have a new log files in ~/.forever/. Whenever it gets too long, you can issue 'echo > ~/.forever/abcd.log'
        to truncate the log of forever process 'abcd'.</p>
      <p>You can test that your http server redirects to your https website, and you can add some basic placeholder information there, or copy and paste
        your profile page from one of your existing web 2.0 identities onto there.</p>

      <h3>Indie Web</h3>
      <p>If you followed this episode, then you will have spent maybe 10 or 20 dollars, and probably about one working day working out how to fit all
        the pieces together and get it working, but you will have made a big leap in terms of your technological freedom: you are now a member of the
        "Indie Web" - the small elite of people who run their own webserver, independently from any big platforms. It's a bit like musicians who publish
        their own vinyls on small independent record labels. And it's definitely something you can be proud of. Now that it's up and running, add some
        nice pages to your website by simply uploading html files to your server.</p>
      <p>From now on you will need your personal server in pretty much all
        coming episodes. For instance, next week we will explore a young but very powerful web technology, which will form an important basis for all
        communications between your personal servers and the unhosted web apps you will be developing: WebSockets. And the week after that, we will
        connect your Indie Web server to Facebook and Twitter... exciting! :) Stay tuned, follow us, and spread the word:
