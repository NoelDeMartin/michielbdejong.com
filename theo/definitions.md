# Definitions

## Computer

A computer is a physical system that represents some truths about a subject system at time t=0, and represents some other truths, derivable from the first set,
about that same system at a later time.

## Dimension

An irreducable question about the observed system; a set of possible answers, one of which is correct; all other possible answers are false.

## Valuation

A set of answers to a set of questions.

## Expression

A tree of operators expressing a relationship between the dimensions.

## Variable

A subsystem of the computer that represents an expression.

## Switch

A subsystem of the computer that enforces a relationship between some variables at time t=0 and some variables at time t=1.

# Causality

The time-forward relationship between a cause and its effect

# Memory

The time-backward relationship between a memory and the event this memory represents

# Forgetting

A time-forward process by which a memory is destroyed



* Feed energy into the computer to operate its switches, and let entropy increase.
* See how information travels between variables, is gathered and partially forgotten, and forms different expressions.
* XOR, for example
* 3-SAT: take information about zeroes (POS) and derive information about ones (SOP).

Why does this take time? All information contained in the eventual outcome is already present in the inputs the computer starts with. It just needs to travel and be
recombined.

You define the computer's state at t=0 and derive its state at t=1 by letting each switch go through 1 step of its FSM.
