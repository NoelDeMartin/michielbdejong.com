# interesting topics to work on

* n-to-n full-bit functions, and how information travels from inputs to outputs (and back) in them
* terminology (e.g. the variable `A` is not the same as the statement `A=0`)
* functions that operate on expressions instead of on bits (needed for investigating 3-SAT)
* minimal expression length
* entropy between sub-problems
* definition of time in graph-logic
* simulating another process in reverse time-direction
